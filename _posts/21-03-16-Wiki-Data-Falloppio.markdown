Wiki-Data is interesting and has a wide variety of benefits, but it is also slightly frustrating depending on the topic. I was attempting to query the "notable works" of early modern anatomists. In the results, I noticed that a very famous work of anatomist Gabriele Falloppio was missing. I then decided to add it to his wiki-data page. However, upon attempting to add the <em>notable work statement</em>, the text I was hoping to link was unfindable. I then had to create a whole new entry for the medical treatise that I wanted to attribute to this author. 

When I was adding Falloppio's text <em>Observationes Anatomicæ</em> the label did not want to work because the text's name was in Latin. Instead of figuring out how to add a Latin label, I just created a label with the translated name and the Latin in parentheses. After making the new entry, I then went back to Falloppio's wiki-data page and was able to add a statement with a notable work label where the entry came up properly.
