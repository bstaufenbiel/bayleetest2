        <description>&lt;p&gt;New Visualizations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use R to render a new image of the court outcomes. The initial image I have, while descriptive, does not show the sheer number of verdicts in each category. The first image here is a text plot that depicts each of the 191 verdicts in their color categorizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second image here shows the percentage breakdown of each category. Traditionally we think of women being persecuted for possible infanticide or other means of child death. However, the data shows that 2/3rds of the women are acquitted of their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>XML Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Old Bailey Proceedings &lt;/em&gt; XML Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text data used for this project is from the &lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/&quot;&gt;Old Bailey Proceedings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The OBP allows for individuals to download files in batches of 10 using their API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data posted on this website is a plain-text rendering of 190 total cases between the years 1664-1789 downloaded in nineteen XML batches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this page you will find a link to the original XML files used before the text was extracted, parsed, and cleaned using OxygenXML.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outcomes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Court Outcomes and Visualization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph illustrates each court verdict’s number and outcome per entry per year. The graph shows that the majority of the entries end in a &lt;em&gt;not guilty&lt;/em&gt; verdict while the rest are &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt;. The most interesting outcomes are the ones that were not clearly defined. Some women were considered innocent legally, but the record shows it was ONLY due to lack of physical evidence. The documents suggest that in the eyes of society, the accused was considered and treated as guilty. Another interesting outcome shows a woman having her sentence commuted due to her falling pregnant again–does this mean that the trial took so long that she had time to become pregnant again, or was she falsely sentenced the first time being that she was already pregnant and could not have killed a baby she did not have yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes allow for overall conclusions to be made about the types and number of verdicts over time. Moreover, the irregularities that show up among these numbers further nuance the reading of these sources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wiki-Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wiki-Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiki-Data is interesting and has a wide variety of benefits, but it is also slightly frustrating depending on the topic. I was attempting to query the “notable works” of early modern anatomists. In the results, I noticed that a very famous work of anatomist Gabriele Falloppio was missing. I then decided to add it to his wiki-data page. However, upon attempting to add the &lt;em&gt;notable work statement&lt;/em&gt;, the text I was hoping to link was unfindable. I then had to create a whole new entry for the medical treatise that I wanted to attribute to this author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was adding Falloppio’s text &lt;em&gt;Observationes Anatomicæ&lt;/em&gt; the label did not want to work because the text’s name was in Latin. Instead of figuring out how to add a Latin label, I just created a label with the translated name and the Latin in parentheses. After making the new entry, I then went back to Falloppio’s wiki-data page and was able to add a statement with a notable work label where the entry came up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177869&quot;&gt;link to Falloppio wiki-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105979517&quot;&gt;link to Observationes Anatomicæ wiki-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Topic Modeling OBP Court Testimony</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Topic Modeling OBP Court Testimony&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic modeling tool is less than zesty. It probably works better with larger data samples that have more variation in their subject matter and text characters. The topics that occurred in my corpus were all very similar and expected regardless of how little or many topics that I asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I took this opportunity to use Voyant-Tools as it does a similar form of Topic Modeling. Since Voyant is “silver/basement-group” friendly, I was able to sift through words to get “word-closeness” and “frequency” data as a different way to judge topic variation. Voyant also allowed me to easily render a visualization which was not happening with the topic modeling tool. Just looking through the words and topics highlighted by Voyant, I can see make several conclusions. For example, many of the infants in these infanticide cases were alive at birth. The bedroom and kitchen were popular rooms where births took place. Often someone overheard or saw the accused with the child after its death or in the process of labor. Keywords, however, can be also be misleading. A common word that popped up, for instance, was “guilty.” Only three of the twelve entries that I compiled had a guilty verdict, the rest of the entries ended in acquittal. The word acquit and its variations appeared less. After looking closer, I noticed that one entry used guilty hypothetically during the transcription of a courtroom conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are benefits to topic modeling, but as with everything, we need to make sure that we are aware of the data that we are entering. Topic modeling will not help if we use it to make overgeneralized conclusions on little information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Court!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data set uses &lt;em&gt;Old Bailey Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; to investigate how female medical practitioners understood the body. What knowledge did they use to impact criminal proceedings in the name of the crown? What medical misconceptions did they perpetuate or challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
