        <p class="post-excerpt">This graph illustrates each court verdict’s number and outcome per entry per year. The graph shows that the majority of the entries end in a not guilty verdict while the rest are guilty. The most interesting outcomes are the ones that were not clearly defined. Some women were considered innocent legally, but the record shows it was ONLY due to lack of physical evidence. The documents suggest that in the eyes of society, the accused was considered and treated as guilty. Another interesting outcome shows a woman having her sentence commuted due to her falling pregnant again–does this mean that the trial took so long that she had time to become pregnant again, or was she falsely sentenced the first time being that she was already pregnant and could not have killed a baby she did not have yet.

        <p class="post-excerpt">Wiki-Data is interesting and has a wide variety of benefits, but it is also slightly frustrating depending on the topic. I was attempting to query the “notable works” of early modern anatomists. In the results, I noticed that a very famous work of anatomist Gabriele Falloppio was missing. I then decided to add it to his wiki-data page. However, upon attempting to add the notable work statement, the text I was hoping to link was unfindable. I then had to create a whole new entry for the medical treatise that I wanted to attribute to this author.
