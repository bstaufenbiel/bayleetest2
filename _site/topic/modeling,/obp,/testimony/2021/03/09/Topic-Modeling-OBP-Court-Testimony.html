<p>The topic modeling tool is less than zesty. It probably works better with larger data samples that have more variation in their subject matter and text characters. The topics that occurred in my corpus were all very similar and expected regardless of how little or many topics that I asked for.</p>

<p>Instead, I took this opportunity to use Voyant-Tools as it does a similar form of Topic Modeling. Since Voyant is “silver/basement-group” friendly, I was able to sift through words to get “word-closeness” and “frequency” data as a different way to judge topic variation. Voyant also allowed me to easily render a visualization which was not happening with the topic modeling tool. Just looking through the words and topics highlighted by Voyant, I can see make several conclusions. For example, many of the infants in these infanticide cases were alive at birth. The bedroom and kitchen were popular rooms where births took place. Often someone overheard or saw the accused with the child after its death or in the process of labor. Keywords, however, can be also be misleading. A common word that popped up, for instance, was “guilty.” Only three of the twelve entries that I compiled had a guilty verdict, the rest of the entries ended in acquittal. The word acquit and its variations appeared less. After looking closer, I noticed that one entry used guilty hypothetically during the transcription of a courtroom conversation.</p>

<p>Overall, there are benefits to topic modeling, but as with everything, we need to make sure that we are aware of the data that we are entering. Topic modeling will not help if we use it to make overgeneralized conclusions on little information.</p>
