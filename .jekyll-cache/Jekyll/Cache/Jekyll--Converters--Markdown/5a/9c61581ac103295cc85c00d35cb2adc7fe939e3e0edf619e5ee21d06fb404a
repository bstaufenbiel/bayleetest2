I"¿<p>Court Outcomes and Visualization</p>

<p>This graph illustrates each court verdictâ€™s number and outcome per entry per year. The graph shows that the majority of the entries end in a <em>not guilty</em> verdict while the rest are <em>guilty</em>. The most interesting outcomes are the ones that were not clearly defined. Some women were considered innocent legally, but the record shows it was ONLY due to lack of physical evidence. The documents suggest that in the eyes of society, the accused was considered and treated as guilty. Another interesting outcome shows a woman having her sentence commuted due to her falling pregnant againâ€“does this mean that the trial took so long that she had time to become pregnant again, or was she falsely sentenced the first time being that she was already pregnant and could not have killed a baby she did not have yet.</p>

<p>The outcomes allow for overall conclusions to be made about the types and number of verdicts over time. Moreover, the irregularities that show up among these numbers further nuance the reading of these sources.</p>
