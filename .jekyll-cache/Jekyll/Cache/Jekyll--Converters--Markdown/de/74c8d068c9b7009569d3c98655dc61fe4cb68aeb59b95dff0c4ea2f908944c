I"2<p>New Visualizations</p>

<p>I wanted to use R to render a new image of the court outcomes. The initial image I have, while descriptive, does not show the sheer number of verdicts in each category. The first image here is a text plot that depicts each of the 191 verdicts in their color categorizations.</p>

<p>The second image here shows the percentage breakdown of each category. Traditionally we think of women being persecuted for possible infanticide or other means of child death. However, the data shows that 2/3rds of the women are acquitted of their crimes.</p>
